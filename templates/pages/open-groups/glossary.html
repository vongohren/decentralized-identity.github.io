 Together we will be working across the whole range of projects and efforts to understand what language is currently being used and to invite understanding and support convergence 
 on some core definitions. We will do this in an open and transparent manner that is as inclusive as possible. We are not (re)creating a comprehensive taxonomy but rather are 
 focusing on a few key terms that are especially critical for wider adoption." %}
