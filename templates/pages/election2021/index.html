          <div class="title-border"><span class="lg"></span><span class="md"></span><span class="sm"></span></div>
          <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.
            </p>
          <p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a  group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.
            </p>
          <p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself.</a></p>

                    Hosting DIF-APAC and setting up DIF-Africa not only offered me a platform to build my communication and organizational skills, but also led to strong relationship with the 
                    community. It is with this attachment that I was inspired to represent Asia-Pacific and Africa at large in a more active role on the DIF Steering Committee. My aim is to voice the concerns of the community and fully represent these two regions of the world. This shall not only reinstate DIF’s ability to nurture diversity in geographical distribution and culture but also offer a sense of enrichment.

                        am actively and inactively (i.e., at the observer level) involved with several initiatives that apply SSI, e.g., CCI, ToIP, and GHPC.</li>
                        <li>Over time, I have developed successful methods in working with local regulators to endorse VCs. My experience would assist DIF in their effort to collaborate with regulators in other countries, especially those in APAC and Africa. </li>

              <tr>
                <td class="bg-light" width="700">I’m pleased to accept the nomination to serve on the DIF steering committee!
                  A little bit about myself: I have been involved in various open source initiatives
                  throughout my adult life, and have been working within the identity space for the
                  last 20 years. I am the primary point of contact for my company’s participation in
                  the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the World Wide Web Consortium
                  (W3C), and the FIDO Alliance, while also participating in efforts within the IETF
                  and OpenID Foundation. I am prepared to commit to also work with the DIF
                  steering committee.
                  <br> <br> 
                  In terms of technical opportunities for DIF, I consider perhaps the most significant
                  one to be the promotion of interoperability. It can be difficult for even those
                  involved in this space to track the technical specifications (and relevant
                  implementations) needed to support various end-to-end protocol scenarios. It
                  can also be challenging to know the various initiatives within different verticals to
                  define use cases, minimal supported technology and common schemas.
                  If elected onto the steering committee, I would push for us to continue the
                  excellent work by the interoperability group members in documenting
                  specifications and initiatives, as well as to further promote that work. The goal
                  would be that the DIF would become the definitive place for people to come and
                  understand the decentralized identity space.

                  <p>Quote: “SSI is at the very heart of digital infrastructure innovation. In an increasingly digital world, socio-economic development can only flourish if those who build technical infrastructure support radical open standards and interoperability.” - Joachim Lohkamp, CEO Jolocom </p>

At Jolocom, we have followed a community-based approach to partnerships and business
development since our start in 2014. As a founding member and board member of the
German Blockchain Association, Jolocom has contributed to the association’s success with
time, energy and relentless motivation. My own involvement in the association’s activities
has thus far been focused on efforts to promote interoperable decentralized identity and distributed ledger infrastructure in Germany, Europe and beyond. Not only has Bundesblock published the worldwide first community lead position paper on digital identities  also we achieved the adoption of a blockchain strategy by the German government. Currently SDI (Secure Digital Identities) lighthouse projects’ implementation phase launched, where the focus lies fully on SSI technology, being funded with 60M € over the next 3 years. Another very meaningful success for the whole SSI ecosystem resulting from continous community work. Further with INATBA an essential Association has been co-founded with our help to extending the work of Bundesblock on SSI and blockchain to EC levels.

<br> <br> 
Jolocom has been a member of DIF for several years contributing to various efforts, like donations of several implementations to DIF (KERI Rust, DIDComm v2 Rust) and full commitment to maintain code bases and continue contributing.
Not least, I would like to point to DWeb where together with Wendy Hannamura and Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive, and many more builders of decentralized tech, Web3 and many more I’m very grateful I had the pleasure to contribute to since 2014.

<br> <br> DIF has achieved a lot on bringing the larger identity community together. With a momentum for convergence around AIP v2 and open standards at DIF and W3C we actually have the chance to bring SSI as an open standards based interoperable infrastructure to reality. It is an exciting phase for all of us and I would like to commit myself and step up my current commitment to DIF further to help build out the fantastic ground work done so far.

<br> <br> Me personally, but also at Jolocom, we dedicate a good part of our resources to community efforts. As every employee at Jolocom, in our community work we are independant form our organization to serve in the best interest of the community.</p>

                    Humble beginnings and growing up in India with limited resources per capita (in the 80s & 90s) taught me to be resourceful and help others via communities, creating shared resources for common good. That's the mantra I've followed since graduating in Comp Science, doing what I love and being a global citizen (fortunate): Open Source innovation FTW, technology for impact and purpose before profit. With Affinidi, I'm pursuing and building on my vision of digital inclusion and economic upliftment by democratizing creation and use of digital identity and credentials. 

                    <br> <br> With Affinidi I'm building use-cases that solve real problems, working with stakeholders/sponsors to enable long term impact and innovation in this space.
I believe in creating ecosystems & marketplaces with open innovation in the Verifiable Credentials space solving most common problems collaboratively, like VC schema development and management for various verticals, Discoverability (credential types, issuer/verifier and metadata) and interoperability across various implementations and providers for faster & better adoption. Continuously learning and pairing up with DIF members and WG's I've grown to appreciate the diversity of ideas, belief in standards and specs while being pragmatic w/ tradeoffs and speed of iteration in DIF.

                      Thomas was CEO and co-founder of evan GmbH, which Blockchains, Inc. acquired earlier this year. With his extensive experience in business and IT, his mission is to develop and establish a standards-based, business-to-business cooperation platform for the digital economy. Furthermore, Thomas is a speaker, author, and expert in the field of decentralized technologies, blockchain for business, and digital business. 
                      <br> <br>Thomas has 15+ years of leadership experience at enterprises and midsize companies. He graduated in computer science at the Technical University Dresden. As managing consultant at T-Systems, he led interdisciplinary teams in numerous enterprise projects. Afterwards, as a member of the management board and was responsible for all aspects of the marketing and sales of a medium-sized software company. 
                      <br> <br>At evan, we've seen the need for a new kind of digital collaboration between companies. Our customers, predominantly mid-sized companies, were falling behind due to inefficient, non-digital ways of working or were increasingly becoming dependent on central industry platforms. With Evan, we created a neutral, de-centralized environment that enables companies to exchange identity-related data securely using blockchain technology, even in multi-party collaborations. We consistently design the technology based on open standards, such as DID and VCs, in the identity area. 
<br> <br>My mission is to build ecosystems, built on open standards with digital identity at their core, for industrial use cases. From resource sharing to supply chain management, I have accompanied projects in building governance structures. Coopetition—the cooperation of companies in the use of shared resources while at the same time competing for customers—is a focus area for me as well. I have always believed that ecosystems only work with trust. Building this trust technologically and keeping it interoperable is the subject of the DIF's work, just as it has consistently been the focus of my own work. In addition to technical standards, adaptation in companies must also be promoted. As a member of the Steering Committee, I would like to work towards this goal.
